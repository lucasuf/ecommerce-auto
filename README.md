| /orders?report=yes  | GET  |  Generate financial report. |
| /order  |  POST |  This action will create a new order. Body application/json can look like this: {reference": "BR001","purchase_channel": "Site BR","client_name": "Lucas Barros","adress": "Apt. 264 813 Chang Flat, Batzton, RI 64332-0289","delivery_service": "SEDEX","total_value": 59.33,"line_items": "Samuel Smithâ€™s Imperial IPA"}. **All values must be informed and access-token, client and uid must be used on header.** |  
| /batches  | POST  | Create a bacth for purchase channel. Body application/json can look like this: {"purchase_channel_batch": "Site BR"}. **Require access-token, client and uid to be used on header.** |  
| /batches  |  GET |  Return a list of all batches. | 
| /batches/S9748737E  |  PATCH |  Update orders based on the body for order S9748737E. If you want to close your application/json body must look like this {"action_batch": "Close"}.

When sending the request set Content-Type: application/json and send{ "email": "test@email.com","password": "password"}, for example (using the same credential informed on /auth). This route will return a JSON representation of the User model on successful login along with the access-token,client and uid in the header of the response. **You must use them on the header of your request.**  | 
| /auth  |  POST | Required for most post actions. When sending the request set Content-Type: application/json and send {"email": "test@email.com","password": "password","password_confirmation": "password"}, for example.
