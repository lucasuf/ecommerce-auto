## 1. Description
This project aims to create an api for manage and visualizing orders and batches of orders. For that, some actions were implemented. The following sections will cover requirements, additional stuff, stack used on the project, how to run, API usage guide and a small explanation of how we can handle some impprovements on the platform.

## 2. Project Requirements
Actions implemented:
- [x] Create a new order
- [x] Get the status of an Order by client name
- [x] List the Orders of a Purchase Channel
- [x] Create a batch for a Purchase Channel
- [x] Produce a Batch 
- [x] Close part of a Batch for a Delivery Service
- [x] Simple financial repport

## 3. Additional Stuff
Some additional features were implemented to improve the plataform:
- [x] WEB UI page for check all of the orders information
- [x] Search in orders mechanism in WEB UI page
- [x] A authorization layer to allow only registered users to use the api
- [x] Functional tests for Order controller 
- [x] Docker-compose for the application 

## 4. Stack used
Some of the thecnologies and tools used in this project:
* ruby on rails
* docker and docker-compose
* postgresql and pgAdmin
* bootstrap
* devise_token_auth
* Faker
* some other gems :)

## 5. How to run
Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/lucasuf/ecommerce-auto.git
```
Inside the project, build docker image
```
docker-compose build
```
Create, migrate and populate db
```
docker-compose run web rake db:create db:migrate db:seed
```
Start application
```
docker-compose up
```
If you want to run order controller tests:
```
docker-compose run web rails test test/controllers/orders_controller_test.rb
```
## 6. API usage guide
| url  | method   | purpose  |
|---|---|---|
| /  | GET  | This action will render index HTML response if no param is informed.  |
| /orders?purchase_channel=Site%20BR&status=ready  |  GET | Find all the orders for a specific purchase channel and status.  |
| /orders?purchase_channel=Site%20BR |  GET |  Find all the orders for a specific purchase channel. |
| /orders?client_name=Lucas  | GET  | Find all the orders for a specific client.   |
| /orders?report=yes  | GET  |  Generate financial report. |
| /order  |  POST |  This action will create a new order. Body application/json can look like this: {reference": "BR001","purchase_channel": "Site BR","client_name": "Lucas Barros","adress": "Apt. 264 813 Chang Flat, Batzton, RI 64332-0289","delivery_service": "SEDEX","total_value": 59.33,"line_items": "Samuel Smithâ€™s Imperial IPA"}. **All values must be informed and access-token, client and uid must be used on header.** |  
| /batches  | POST  | Create a bacth for purchase channel. Body application/json can look like this: {"purchase_channel_batch": "Site BR"}. **Require access-token, client and uid to be used on header.** |  
| /batches  |  GET |  Return a list of all batches. | 
| /batches/S9748737E  |  PATCH |  Update orders based on the body for order S9748737E. If you want to close your application/json body must look like this {"action_batch": "Close"}. On the other hand, if you want to send, you have to send an application/json like {"action_batch": "Send","delivery_service": "SEDEX"}. **Require access-token, client and uid to be used on header.** | 
|  /auth/sign_in | POST  | Sign in on the plataform. It will return the parameters required on the header of some other actions. When sending the request set Content-Type: application/json and send{ "email": "test@email.com","password": "password"}, for example (using the same credential informed on /auth). This route will return a JSON representation of the User model on successful login along with the access-token,client and uid in the header of the response. **You must use them on the header of your request.**  | 
| /auth  |  POST | Required for most post actions. When sending the request set Content-Type: application/json and send {"email": "test@email.com","password": "password","password_confirmation": "password"}, for example. For more information [check usage guide](https://devise-token-auth.gitbook.io/devise-token-auth/usage). | 
> I used Postman to validate those methods. It has a good interface and it's easy to use :)

## 7. How can we handle some other features:
* A security layer, to prevent script kiddies from messing up our Orders and putting on YouTube.
> Only users with staff and admin priveleges can create new users and edit their permissions. We would have a permission associated with our entities and actions, that can be given to other users. It would prevent scripts to create and messing up with our platform.
* A permission layer, that way we can be sure that each user is only working with their stuff.
> To ensure that users only work with their orders, I would compare client name attribute with user name. If it's equal, then he can work with the order.
* ~~Sometimes people confuses Moto G5 with Moto G5S and we need a way to modify Orders in production. ~~
> Already implemented on update method for order in controller
* A web UI to control everything directly, without the need of going thought the API.
> List all orders were implemented using bootstrap. For cover all other actions, I would create some other blocks with corresponding inputs, and trigger the remain methods from the controllers. I would also create a login page, in order to authenticate our users.
